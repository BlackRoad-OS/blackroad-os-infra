    notes: |
      Placeholder apex origin. Replace with the ingress or load balancer address when Railway- or Kubernetes-backed origins are
      required. Cloudflare proxy remains on for TLS and edge caching even when origin is updated.
  - type: AAAA
    name: "@"
    content: "2001:db8::1"
    proxied: true
    ttl: 3600
    notes: Placeholder IPv6 apex origin. Mirrors the IPv4 note above.
  - type: CNAME
    name: www
    content: blackroad-os-web.pages.dev
    proxied: true
    ttl: 3600
    notes: Cloudflare Pages serves the public web at www; Railway fallback can re-point this CNAME to a service hostname.
