1. **Copy the Template**: Copy this file to create a new tracking document for your project
2. **Update Project Info**: Fill in the project name, week, and overall status in the header
3. **Update Status Indicators**: Use the emoji legend to update status:
   - 🟢 = Work is complete for this stage
   - 🟡 = Work is currently in progress
   - 🔴 = Work is blocked (add notes about blockers)

### Status Indicator Guidelines

- Use **🟢 (done)** when work for that deliverable at that stage is 100% complete
- Use **🟡 (in progress)** when work is actively being done (1-99% complete)
- Use **🔴 (blocked)** when work cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
- Use **⚪️ (empty)** when work has not been started yet
- Use **⭕ (pending)** when work is done but awaiting review or approval

### Best Practices

- Update the tracker at least once per week
- Add notes or links to detailed deliverables in the Deliverables section
- Use the Progress Summary to communicate status in standups or reports
- Customize stage labels to match your team's workflow
