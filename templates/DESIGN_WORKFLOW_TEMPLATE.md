3. **Update Status Indicators**: Use the emoji legend to update status:
   - 🟢 = Work is complete for this stage
   - 🟡 = Work is currently in progress
   - 🔴 = Work is blocked (add notes about blockers)

### Status Indicator Guidelines

- Use **🟢 (done)** when work for that deliverable at that stage is 100% complete
- Use **🟡 (in progress)** when work is actively being done (1-99% complete)

### Best Practices
