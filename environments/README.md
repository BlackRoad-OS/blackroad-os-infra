# Environments (Legacy Placeholder)

This directory previously described environment configurations. Active Terraform environment definitions now live under [`envs/`](../envs/).

## Current Layout

- `envs/dev` — Development
- `envs/staging` — Pre-production
- `envs/prod` — Production

Refer to the `envs/<env>/README.md` files for how to plan/apply infrastructure.
