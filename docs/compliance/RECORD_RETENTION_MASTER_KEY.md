## 📚 Rule Anchors (The "Why" Behind the Stamps)

### BD (Broker-Dealer) Rules

| Requirement | Rule Reference | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Lifetime retention | SEA Rule 17a-4(a) | Partnership articles, minute books, stock records |
| 6-year default | SEA Rule 17a-4(b) | Most BD records; 6 years after account closure for customer accounts |
| 3-year records | SEA Rule 17a-4(b)(4) | Communications, confirmations, order tickets, compliance manual |
| 4-year complaints | FINRA Rule 4513 | Written customer complaints |
| 2-year readily accessible | SEA Rule 17a-4(b) | First 2 years must be immediately accessible |
| Electronic storage | SEA Rule 17a-4(f) | WORM, non-erasable, FINRA notice |

### IA (Investment Advisor) Rules

| Requirement | Rule Reference | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 5-year retention | IA Act Rule 204-2(e)(1) | Books and records must be preserved for 5 years |
| 2-year office requirement | IA Act Rule 204-2(e)(1) | First 2 years in principal office |
| Electronic storage controls | IA Act Rule 204-2(g) | Safeguards, access limits, retrieval capabilities |

### Key Regulatory Principles

1. **Longer Period Rule**: If requirements differ between federal and state, or between BD and IA, preserve for the **longer period**
2. **Account Closure Trigger**: For customer account records, retention period begins **after account closure**, not during active relationship
3. **Superseded Documents**: When updating compliance manuals or procedures, retain superseded versions for required retention period
4. **E-Storage Pre-Approval**: BD firms must notify FINRA 90+ days **before** implementing electronic storage systems
