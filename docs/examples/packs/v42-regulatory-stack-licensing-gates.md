## TEMPLATE v42-A — "Who Sits Above Who" (7-Layer Map)

### Regulatory Hierarchy

The financial services industry operates under a clear hierarchical structure of oversight and regulation:

```
🧭 Layer:  1️⃣  2️⃣  3️⃣  4️⃣  5️⃣  6️⃣  7️⃣

🏛️ Law/Rules        🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢  (Federal securities laws, state laws)
🏢 SEC (oversight)   🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢⚪️⚪️  (Securities and Exchange Commission)
🛡️ SRO / FINRA       🟢🟢🟢🟢⚪️⚪️⚪️  (Self-Regulatory Organization under SEC)
🏦 Member firm       🟢🟢🟢⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️  (Broker-dealer firms registered with FINRA)
👩‍⚖️ Principals      🟢🟢⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️  (Supervisory personnel at member firms)
🧑‍💼 Reps / IARs      🟢⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️  (Registered Representatives / Investment Advisor Reps)
👥 Clients           🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢⚪️  (Individual and institutional investors)
```

### Key Relationships

- **Law/Rules** (Layer 1-7): Federal and state securities laws govern the entire ecosystem
- **SEC** (Layer 1-5): Federal regulator with authority over securities markets and SROs
- **FINRA** (Layer 1-4): Self-Regulatory Organization operating under SEC authority
  - Writes and enforces rules for member firms
  - Administers qualification examinations
  - Maintains the Central Registration Depository (CRD)
  - Conducts examinations and investigations
- **Member Firms** (Layer 1-3): Broker-dealers registered with and supervised by FINRA
- **Principals** (Layer 1-2): Supervisory personnel responsible for firm compliance
- **Reps/IARs** (Layer 1): Front-line professionals who interact with clients
- **Clients** (Layer 1-6): Protected by the entire regulatory framework

### Authority Flow

```
Law/Rules → SEC → FINRA → Member Firm → Principals → Reps → Clients
   ↓         ↓       ↓          ↓            ↓         ↓        ↓
Statute   Enforce  Rules    Register    Supervise   Serve   Protected
