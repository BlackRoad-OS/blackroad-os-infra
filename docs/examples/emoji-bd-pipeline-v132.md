## 📊 Pipeline Overview

This example demonstrates how to use emoji-based visualization to track multiple deals through a standardized 7-stage business development pipeline. Each deal (D1-D7) progresses through stages from initial contact to closed-won.

### Legend

|-------|-------|-------------|
| 🟢 | **MOVING** | Deal is actively progressing, healthy velocity |
| 🟡 | **WAITING** | Deal is paused, awaiting response or next action |
| 🔴 | **STUCK** | Deal is blocked, needs intervention |
| ⚪️ | **EMPTY** | No deal present in this stage |
| ⭕ | **GATE** | Decision gate/checkpoint stage |
| 🏁 | **WIN** | Deal closed successfully |

## 🎓 Best Practices

### DO ✅
- **Update daily:** Keep status current to maintain visibility
- **Be honest about blockers:** Mark deals as 🔴 STUCK when appropriate
- **Document next actions:** Always know what needs to happen next
- **Review stage times:** If deals sit >2x average, investigate
- **Celebrate wins:** Update to 🏁 immediately upon close

### DON'T ❌
- **Don't ghost deals:** If a deal is dead, mark it as such (remove from pipeline)
- **Don't skip stages:** Every deal should flow through all stages (unless fast-tracked)
- **Don't inflate probabilities:** Be realistic about close likelihood
- **Don't forget follow-ups:** Set reminders for 🟡 WAITING deals
- **Don't work in isolation:** Share blockers with team for help
