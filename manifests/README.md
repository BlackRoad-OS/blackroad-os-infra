# Truth Manifests 🔐

This directory contains cryptographic Truth Manifests generated by the Gaia agent.

## Files

- **`truth-manifest-latest.json`** - Current Truth Manifest (JSON format)
- **`truth-manifest-{timestamp}.json`** - Historical archives with timestamps

## Structure

Each manifest contains:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "generated": "2025-12-24T04:28:12.793Z",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "BR-OS Core",
      "target": "blackroad-os-core",
      "hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
    }
  ],
  "rootHash": "6f5096af9801e57814582a36c126b0a459246508d2bbbc7100a3ee068925bec4"
}
```

## Components

The manifest tracks these core BlackRoad OS components:

| Component | Target Identity | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| BR-OS Core | blackroad-os-core | Core operating system |
| Lucidia Logic | lucidia-core | Lucidia AI logic engine |
| Pi-Ops Mesh | blackroad-pi-ops | Raspberry Pi operations |
| Trinity Auth | blackroad-os-api | Trinity authentication system |

## Root Hash

The `rootHash` is calculated from the combined hashes of all components. Any change to even a single character in any component will result in a different root hash, triggering a **PS-SHA-∞ alert**.

## Automation

Manifests are automatically generated and committed by the [Gaia Truth Manifest workflow](../.github/workflows/gaia-truth-manifest.yml):

- Runs after any workflow completion
- Runs daily at 00:00 UTC
- Can be manually triggered via workflow dispatch

## Verification

To verify a component locally:

```bash
cd cli
npm run build
node dist/index.js gaia --verify blackroad-os-core
```

To generate a fresh manifest:

```bash
node dist/index.js gaia --manifest --json
```

## Security

These manifests provide:

- **Mathematical Certainty** - SHA-256 cryptographic verification
- **Tamper Detection** - Any change breaks the signature
- **Historical Audit Trail** - Timestamped archives
- **Open Verification** - Anyone can validate the hashes
